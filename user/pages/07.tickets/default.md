    <div class="silver-medal-copy center">
        <p>Built by Masons, Hope Lodge 145 was built in 1916 as a beautifully ornate, Gothic Revival-style structure. It's location in Downtown Lafayette, directly across the street from the parking garage, makes this the ideal location for our Order's ceremony. (Attendees may recognize this spot as the former Stan's and Sizzling Monkey.)</p>
        <p>And while the downstairs space serves as an elegant event venue, the upstairs transforms into the 2nd Floor Nightclub.</p>
